# Misc helper classes for the ESP

These classes provide various functionality and hardware drivers for the ESP32. 

They many have been taken from the esp-idf example code line as well as the
Arduino lines, while others are by me. I have left the attributions in each of
the files speek for themselves. Assume that if a file has no attribution it is
licensed under the GPL 2.0 license.

Currently to make use of these, a symbilic link needs to be made in the main
folder of the ESP32 to this folder. Quite often the link should be name
*cpp_components*
